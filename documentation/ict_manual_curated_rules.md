## üìä MARKET STRUCTURE RULES

### Rule 1: Market Structure Identification
**When**: Before entering any trade
**Rule**: "Market structure is defined by higher highs and higher lows for uptrend, or lower highs and lower lows for downtrend. Always identify current market structure on higher timeframes before trading."
**Risk Level**: HIGH - Trading against structure leads to losses

### Rule 2: Break of Structure (BOS)
**When**: Price breaks previous swing high/low
**Rule**: "A break of structure occurs when price takes out the previous swing high in an uptrend or swing low in a downtrend. Wait for confirmation before trading the new direction."
**Risk Level**: HIGH - False breaks are common

### Rule 3: Change of Character (CHOCH)
**When**: Market structure changes direction
**Rule**: "Change of character happens when an uptrend creates a lower low or downtrend creates a higher high. This signals potential trend reversal."
**Risk Level**: HIGH - Trend changes can be costly if missed

## üèóÔ∏è ORDER BLOCK RULES

### Rule 4: Order Block Definition
**When**: Identifying institutional order flow
**Rule**: "An order block is the last opposing candle before a strong directional move. Bullish order blocks are the last down-closing candle before upward displacement."
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM - Entry timing critical

### Rule 5: Order Block Entry
**When**: Price returns to order block level
**Rule**: "Enter trades when price returns to an order block with confirmation from lower timeframe. Look for rejection at the level, not just arrival."
**Risk Level**: HIGH - Entry timing affects risk/reward

### Rule 6: Order Block Invalidation
**When**: Price closes through order block
**Rule**: "An order block becomes invalid when price closes below a bullish order block or above a bearish order block. Exit trades immediately upon invalidation."
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Invalidated blocks often lead to major moves against position

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è FAIR VALUE GAP (FVG) RULES

### Rule 7: Fair Value Gap Identification
**When**: Analyzing price inefficiencies
**Rule**: "A fair value gap is a three-candle pattern where the first candle's high/low doesn't overlap with the third candle's low/high, creating an imbalance."
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM - Must distinguish from regular gaps

### Rule 8: FVG Trading Direction
**When**: Trading fair value gaps
**Rule**: "Trade in the direction of the displacement that created the fair value gap. Bearish FVGs are resistance, bullish FVGs are support."
**Risk Level**: HIGH - Wrong direction leads to immediate losses

### Rule 9: FVG Partial Fill Rule
**When**: Price approaches fair value gap
**Rule**: "Fair value gaps don't always fill completely. A partial fill (50-75%) may provide optimal entry, especially in strong trending moves."
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM - Waiting for full fill may miss entry

---

## üíß LIQUIDITY RULES

### Rule 10: Liquidity Identification
**When**: Analyzing potential price targets
**Rule**: "Liquidity rests above old highs (buy stops) and below old lows (sell stops). Equal highs and lows create strong liquidity pools."
**Risk Level**: LOW - Identification skill, not trade execution

### Rule 11: Liquidity Sweep Entry
**When**: Price takes out highs/lows
**Rule**: "Enter opposite to the sweep direction after liquidity is taken. If buy stops are hit above highs, look for short opportunities as price reverses."
**Risk Level**: HIGH - Timing critical, false sweeps possible

### Rule 12: Internal vs External Liquidity
**When**: Choosing trade targets
**Rule**: "Target external liquidity (outside current range) for higher probability moves. Internal liquidity may cause price to consolidate."
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM - Affects profit potential

---

## ‚è∞ SESSION RULES

### Rule 13: London Session Characteristics
**When**: Trading 2:00-5:00 AM EST
**Rule**: "London session often creates the daily range. Look for initial displacement and potential reversals during this session."
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM - High volatility session

### Rule 14: New York Session Characteristics  
**When**: Trading 8:00-11:00 AM EST
**Rule**: "New York session tends to continue or reverse London's move. First hour is crucial for determining daily bias."
**Risk Level**: HIGH - Major reversals common

### Rule 15: Asian Session Characteristics
**When**: Trading 6:00 PM - 2:00 AM EST
**Rule**: "Asian session is typically range-bound. Use this time to identify key levels for London/NY sessions."
**Risk Level**: LOW - Lower volatility, good for analysis

---

## üõ°Ô∏è RISK MANAGEMENT RULES

### Rule 16: Position Size Rule
**When**: Before every trade
**Rule**: "Never risk more than 1-2% of account balance per trade. Calculate position size based on stop loss distance, not desired profit."
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Account survival depends on this

### Rule 17: Stop Loss Placement
**When**: Entering trades
**Rule**: "Place stop losses beyond structural invalidation points, not at round numbers or arbitrary distances. Use order block highs/lows as reference."
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Wrong stop placement = guaranteed losses

### Rule 18: Risk-Reward Minimum
**When**: Evaluating trade setups
**Rule**: "Minimum 1:2 risk-to-reward ratio required. Only take trades where profit target is at least twice the stop loss distance."
**Risk Level**: HIGH - Poor R:R leads to long-term losses

### Rule 19: Maximum Daily Risk
**When**: Managing multiple trades
**Rule**: "Limit daily risk to 6% of account. Stop trading for the day if this limit is reached to prevent emotional revenge trading."
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Prevents catastrophic drawdown

---

## üéØ ENTRY AND EXIT RULES

### Rule 20: Entry Confirmation
**When**: Taking trade entries
**Rule**: "Always wait for lower timeframe confirmation before entering. Don't enter solely based on higher timeframe analysis."
**Risk Level**: HIGH - Reduces false signals

### Rule 21: Partial Profit Taking
**When**: Trade moves in your favor
**Rule**: "Take 25-50% profits at first target, move stop to breakeven, let remainder run to final target or trailing stop."
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM - Balances profit security with potential

### Rule 22: Breakeven Rule
**When**: Trade is profitable
**Rule**: "Move stop loss to breakeven when trade reaches 1:1 risk-reward ratio. This ensures minimum breakeven on winning trades."
**Risk Level**: LOW - Protects capital

### Rule 23: Trailing Stop Method
**When**: Managing winning trades
**Rule**: "Trail stops based on market structure, not arbitrary distances. Use swing lows in uptrends, swing highs in downtrends."
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM - Structure-based trailing is safer

---

## üìà TIMEFRAME ANALYSIS RULES

### Rule 24: Timeframe Hierarchy
**When**: Analyzing markets
**Rule**: "Start analysis on higher timeframes (Daily, 4H) for bias, then use lower timeframes (1H, 15M) for precise entries."
**Risk Level**: HIGH - Wrong timeframe analysis = wrong bias

### Rule 25: Multi-Timeframe Confluence
**When**: Validating setups
**Rule**: "Best setups have confluence across multiple timeframes. Daily bias + 4H structure + 1H entry = high probability."
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM - More confluence = higher probability

---

## üö´ FORBIDDEN PRACTICES

### Rule 26: Never Move Stops Against Position
**When**: Trade goes against you
**Rule**: "NEVER move stop loss against your position to 'give the trade more room'. This is the fastest way to destroy an account."
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Account killer

### Rule 27: No Revenge Trading
**When**: After losses
**Rule**: "Never immediately re-enter after a loss to 'get money back'. Take a break, reassess, wait for proper setup."
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Emotional trading destroys accounts

### Rule 28: Don't Trade Major News
**When**: High-impact news releases
**Rule**: "Avoid trading 30 minutes before and after major news unless you're an expert at news trading. Spreads widen and volatility spikes."
**Risk Level**: HIGH - Unpredictable price action

### Rule 29: No Round Number Stops
**When**: Placing stop losses
**Rule**: "Never place stops at obvious round numbers (e.g., 1.2000, 1.2500). Everyone else does this, making them obvious targets for manipulation."
**Risk Level**: HIGH - Obvious stops get hunted

### Rule 30: Don't Overtrade
**When**: Looking for trades
**Rule**: "Quality over quantity. Better to take 2-3 high-probability trades per week than 20 mediocre ones."
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM - Overtrading increases costs and errors

## üí° ADVANCED ICT CONCEPTS

### Rule 31: Premium vs Discount
**When**: Entering trades
**Rule**: "Buy at discount (below 50% of range), sell at premium (above 50% of range). Use daily/weekly ranges to determine premium/discount areas."
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM - Improves entry timing

### Rule 32: Algorithmic Price Delivery
**When**: Understanding market mechanics
**Rule**: "Price is delivered algorithmically to liquidity and inefficiencies. Markets aren't random - they seek specific levels for specific reasons."
**Risk Level**: LOW - Conceptual understanding

### Rule 33: Smart Money vs Dumb Money
**When**: Analyzing market moves
**Rule**: "Follow smart money (institutions), fade dumb money (retail). Smart money creates displacement, dumb money creates consolidation."
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM - Helps identify trade direction
