## ü§ñ AI Model Training Guidelines

### Primary Training Document
Use **`ai_training_data.txt`** as the main training input:
- Clean, structured format optimized for AI consumption
- Conceptually organized by ICT methodology
- Trading workflow clearly defined
- Minimal noise and maximum signal

### Supplementary Resources
- **JSON Database:** For programmatic rule lookup and validation
- **Concept Files:** For deep-dive training on specific areas
- **Quick Reference:** For rapid decision-making patterns
- **Complete Manual:** For comprehensive methodology understanding

### Training Objectives
1. **Pattern Recognition:** Identify ICT setups in market data
2. **Decision Making:** Apply when/how/what/why/where framework
3. **Risk Management:** Implement proper position sizing and stops
4. **Market Structure:** Analyze trends and structural changes
5. **Session Awareness:** Adapt strategy to market sessions

## üéØ Trading System Implementation

### Core Decision Engine
```python
def trading_decision(market_data):
    # 1. Market Structure Analysis
    structure = analyze_market_structure(market_data)
    
    # 2. Concept Identification  
    concepts = identify_ict_concepts(market_data)
    
    # 3. Rule Application
    applicable_rules = get_rules(concepts, market_conditions)
    
    # 4. Risk Assessment
    risk_params = calculate_risk(applicable_rules)
    
    # 5. Execution Decision
    return make_trading_decision(structure, concepts, rules, risk_params)
```

### Rule Hierarchy
1. **Risk Rules:** Never violated (stop loss, position size)
2. **Structural Rules:** Market bias and trend direction
3. **Entry Rules:** Setup identification and confirmation
4. **Management Rules:** Trade progression and exits
5. **Session Rules:** Time-based strategy adjustments

---

## üìà Key Trading Rules Summary

### Universal Principles
- **Risk Management:** Never risk more than 1-2% per trade
- **Market Structure:** Always trade with the trend
- **Liquidity Awareness:** Target areas where stops are positioned
- **Session Timing:** Adapt strategy to market sessions
- **Confirmation:** Wait for proper setup confirmation

### Entry Criteria
- Market structure shift or continuation confirmed
- High-probability order block or FVG identified
- Proper risk-reward ratio (minimum 1:2)
- Confluence of multiple ICT concepts
- Appropriate session timing

### Exit Strategy
- Predefined profit targets at key levels
- Stop loss management based on structure
- Partial profit taking methodology
- Trail stops using market structure
- Exit on structural changes
