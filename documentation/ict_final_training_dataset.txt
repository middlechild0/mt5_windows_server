we have the run here creating the initial buy&nbsp;
side liquidity and the low taking that out here&nbsp;&nbsp;
so we have a minor cell side liquidity pool&nbsp;
we're working the initial cell side liquidity&nbsp;
that initial liquidity is an interest to me&nbsp;&nbsp;
so that disrupted all that price action over
the minor cell side liquidity it's inside the&nbsp;&nbsp;
highlighted as a layered cells side liquidity pool&nbsp;&nbsp;
which is initial buy side we've already ran that&nbsp;&nbsp;
and started to sell off so on the on the buy side&nbsp;
to tell me for a buy or sell it's not giving&nbsp;
like supposed diagonal support and resistance&nbsp;&nbsp;
price action and they're they're hinting to the&nbsp;
about last week where we have Smart money Concepts&nbsp;
time and price and liquidity and inefficiencies if&nbsp;&nbsp;
Central tenants that go along with retail trading&nbsp;&nbsp;
um you can just trade the just the price action&nbsp;&nbsp;
when we have opportunities to see the price action&nbsp;
what you're looking for if you're if you're afraid&nbsp;&nbsp;
see a limit order was filled you see they a stop&nbsp;&nbsp;
me the opportunity and displacement and and it&nbsp;
ran to obvious levels of liquidity it took out&nbsp;&nbsp;
this shortterm low I wasn't interested in having&nbsp;
idea and then I see a displacement I might in&nbsp;&nbsp;
a short with a fair value Gap a institutional&nbsp;&nbsp;
order flow entry drill um I don't know maybe a&nbsp;
bearish order block something something to that&nbsp;&nbsp;
and this one here has a lot of liquidity in it&nbsp;&nbsp;
liquidity big big players in the marketplace are&nbsp;
the market will go just above a short-term High&nbsp;
and Wednesday I would go back in and short up&nbsp;
above it it rallied up it took liquidity and&nbsp;&nbsp;
have an old new day opening Gap here we'll have&nbsp;
last week that the new day opening gaps have a&nbsp;&nbsp;
back into new day opening gap of the 9th okay&nbsp;&nbsp;
so that's Friday new day opening Gap that would&nbsp;
algorithmic so it has to refer back to those same&nbsp;&nbsp;
of the layered liquidity here upper quadrant&nbsp;
it works and smart money concepts are nonsense and&nbsp;
there's no algorithm but here you again I told you&nbsp;&nbsp;
I would not be interested in trying to buy it&nbsp;&nbsp;
nice displacement lower it just really just tore&nbsp;
following along and went short take your profits&nbsp;&nbsp;
as the initial point of buy side liquidity&nbsp;&nbsp;
fizzling out and they are no no longer supporting&nbsp;&nbsp;
buying and being profitable or you're selling and&nbsp;&nbsp;
being profitable and all the losses in between and&nbsp;
and you understand the effects of manipulation&nbsp;&nbsp;
going to go up to this level buy it at this&nbsp;&nbsp;
it's almost like uh reading price action isn't it&nbsp;
so the buy side is taken and just for good measure&nbsp;
Gap okay and the market trades up into the fair&nbsp;&nbsp;
lower and then we have displacement in here so&nbsp;
if we go back through all this price action here&nbsp;&nbsp;
and say okay I can see the fair value gaps I can&nbsp;
see the inversion fair value gaps he's talking&nbsp;&nbsp;
about I can see um I can see the order blocks okay&nbsp;
trying to trade and get short I'm going to use&nbsp;
fill but it doesn't do it and it runs the other&nbsp;
and the pawns will fall so if I share my stop loss&nbsp;&nbsp;
creating liquidity and even a larger Bullseye so&nbsp;
think they understand fair value gaps and whatnot&nbsp;
sell off not if you don't have the information&nbsp;
idea of my order block and because they tried to&nbsp;
named ICT and these smart money Concepts and they&nbsp;&nbsp;
that movie well the same thing in price action if&nbsp;&nbsp;
in the London session or trading the afternoon&nbsp;
time determining where the liquidity is and then&nbsp;
bearish order block why because it's going above&nbsp;&nbsp;
listen folks this is for order block fans okay&nbsp;
my order block does not require the trade below&nbsp;&nbsp;
my interest was being short I wanted to be short&nbsp;
trade or maybe it didn't give me a fill and or it&nbsp;
uh weekly previous week's range to be profitable&nbsp;&nbsp;
probabilities are better in the short than going&nbsp;&nbsp;
week determine what your initial high for buy side&nbsp;
is and what your initial low is for your sell side&nbsp;&nbsp;
bias that bias doesn't have to be the daily range&nbsp;
and and we have new day opening gaps below the&nbsp;
Market's going to discover probe into discount&nbsp;
chart that closing price right there validates&nbsp;&nbsp;
this is a bearish order block all I need to do is&nbsp;
open below this and then trade up where's my fill&nbsp;&nbsp;
and trades up I'm selling short when the Market's&nbsp;
going up okay stop loss goes to rejection block&nbsp;&nbsp;
which is the close on the order block so we have a&nbsp;
to the initial buy side liquidity that's these&nbsp;
back there because there is an algorithm I know&nbsp;
it to you every day and the market trades again&nbsp;
there's a volume imbalance there so you have to&nbsp;
this is probably boring you but long story short&nbsp;
here that justifies that fill except for I pushed&nbsp;&nbsp;
my inefficiencies and fair value gaps whether&nbsp;&nbsp;
how you know the algorithm is doing exactly what&nbsp;&nbsp;
and price and what the algorithm is doing what the&nbsp;&nbsp;
algorithm is doing this and when the algorithm is&nbsp;
to believe there's an algorithm but then when you&nbsp;
algorithm I'm enjoying the fact that I'm rubbing&nbsp;
fair value Gap that should act as resistance&nbsp;&nbsp;
or if you are using a reclaimed fair value Gap&nbsp;
