============================================================

MARKET STRUCTURE ANALYSIS:

Rule: Market structure is defined by higher highs and higher lows for uptrend, or lower highs and lower lows for downtrend. Always identify current market structure on higher timeframes before trading.
Priority: CRITICAL - Trading against structure leads to losses
Application: Before entering any trade

Rule: A break of structure occurs when price takes out the previous swing high in an uptrend or swing low in a downtrend. Wait for confirmation before trading the new direction.
Priority: CRITICAL - False breaks are common
Application: When price breaks previous swing high/low

Rule: Change of character happens when an uptrend creates a lower low or downtrend creates a higher high. This signals potential trend reversal.
Priority: CRITICAL - Trend changes can be costly if missed
Application: When market structure changes direction

============================================================

ORDER BLOCK METHODOLOGY:

Rule: An order block is the last opposing candle before a strong directional move. Bullish order blocks are the last down-closing candle before upward displacement.
Priority: HIGH - Entry timing critical
Application: When identifying institutional order flow

Rule: Enter trades when price returns to an order block with confirmation from lower timeframe. Look for rejection at the level, not just arrival.
Priority: CRITICAL - Entry timing affects risk/reward
Application: When price returns to order block level

Rule: An order block becomes invalid when price closes below a bullish order block or above a bearish order block. Exit trades immediately upon invalidation.
Priority: CRITICAL - Invalidated blocks often lead to major moves against position
Application: When price closes through order block

============================================================

FAIR VALUE GAP TRADING:

Rule: A fair value gap is a three-candle pattern where the first candle's high/low doesn't overlap with the third candle's low/high, creating an imbalance.
Priority: HIGH - Must distinguish from regular gaps
Application: When analyzing price inefficiencies

Rule: Trade in the direction of the displacement that created the fair value gap. Bearish FVGs are resistance, bullish FVGs are support.
Priority: CRITICAL - Wrong direction leads to immediate losses
Application: When trading fair value gaps

Rule: Fair value gaps don't always fill completely. A partial fill (50-75%) may provide optimal entry, especially in strong trending moves.
Priority: HIGH - Waiting for full fill may miss entry
Application: When price approaches fair value gap

============================================================

LIQUIDITY CONCEPTS:

Rule: Liquidity rests above old highs (buy stops) and below old lows (sell stops). Equal highs and lows create strong liquidity pools.
Priority: MEDIUM - Identification skill affects targeting
Application: When analyzing potential price targets

Rule: Enter opposite to the sweep direction after liquidity is taken. If buy stops are hit above highs, look for short opportunities as price reverses.
Priority: CRITICAL - Timing critical, false sweeps possible
Application: When price takes out highs/lows

Rule: Target external liquidity (outside current range) for higher probability moves. Internal liquidity may cause price to consolidate.
Priority: HIGH - Affects profit potential
Application: When choosing trade targets

============================================================

SESSION CHARACTERISTICS:

Rule: London session often creates the daily range. Look for initial displacement and potential reversals during this session.
Priority: HIGH - High volatility session
Application: Trading 2:00-5:00 AM EST

Rule: New York session tends to continue or reverse London's move. First hour is crucial for determining daily bias.
Priority: CRITICAL - Major reversals common
Application: Trading 8:00-11:00 AM EST

Rule: Asian session is typically range-bound. Use this time to identify key levels for London/NY sessions.
Priority: MEDIUM - Lower volatility, good for analysis
Application: Trading 6:00 PM - 2:00 AM EST

============================================================

RISK MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL:

Rule: Never risk more than 1-2% of account balance per trade. Calculate position size based on stop loss distance, not desired profit.
Priority: CRITICAL - Account survival depends on this
Application: Before every trade

Rule: Place stop losses beyond structural invalidation points, not at round numbers or arbitrary distances. Use order block highs/lows as reference.
Priority: CRITICAL - Wrong stop placement equals guaranteed losses
Application: When entering trades

Rule: Minimum 1:2 risk-to-reward ratio required. Only take trades where profit target is at least twice the stop loss distance.
Priority: CRITICAL - Poor R:R leads to long-term losses
Application: When evaluating trade setups

Rule: Limit daily risk to 6% of account. Stop trading for the day if this limit is reached to prevent emotional revenge trading.
Priority: CRITICAL - Prevents catastrophic drawdown
Application: When managing multiple trades

============================================================

ENTRY AND EXIT MANAGEMENT:

Rule: Always wait for lower timeframe confirmation before entering. Don't enter solely based on higher timeframe analysis.
Priority: CRITICAL - Reduces false signals
Application: When taking trade entries

Rule: Take 25-50% profits at first target, move stop to breakeven, let remainder run to final target or trailing stop.
Priority: HIGH - Balances profit security with potential
Application: When trade moves in your favor

Rule: Move stop loss to breakeven when trade reaches 1:1 risk-reward ratio. This ensures minimum breakeven on winning trades.
Priority: HIGH - Protects capital
Application: When trade is profitable

Rule: Trail stops based on market structure, not arbitrary distances. Use swing lows in uptrends, swing highs in downtrends.
Priority: HIGH - Structure-based trailing is safer
Application: When managing winning trades

============================================================

TIMEFRAME ANALYSIS HIERARCHY:

Rule: Start analysis on higher timeframes (Daily, 4H) for bias, then use lower timeframes (1H, 15M) for precise entries.
Priority: CRITICAL - Wrong timeframe analysis equals wrong bias
Application: When analyzing markets

Rule: Best setups have confluence across multiple timeframes. Daily bias plus 4H structure plus 1H entry equals high probability.
Priority: HIGH - More confluence equals higher probability
Application: When validating setups

============================================================

FORBIDDEN PRACTICES (NEVER DO):

Rule: NEVER move stop loss against your position to give the trade more room. This is the fastest way to destroy an account.
Priority: CRITICAL - Account killer
Application: When trade goes against you

Rule: Never immediately re-enter after a loss to get money back. Take a break, reassess, wait for proper setup.
Priority: CRITICAL - Emotional trading destroys accounts
Application: After losses

Rule: Avoid trading 30 minutes before and after major news unless you're an expert at news trading. Spreads widen and volatility spikes.
Priority: CRITICAL - Unpredictable price action
Application: During high-impact news releases

Rule: Never place stops at obvious round numbers. Everyone else does this, making them obvious targets for manipulation.
Priority: CRITICAL - Obvious stops get hunted
Application: When placing stop losses

Rule: Quality over quantity. Better to take 2-3 high-probability trades per week than 20 mediocre ones.
Priority: HIGH - Overtrading increases costs and errors
Application: When looking for trades

============================================================

ADVANCED CONCEPTS:

Rule: Buy at discount (below 50% of range), sell at premium (above 50% of range). Use daily/weekly ranges to determine premium/discount areas.
Priority: HIGH - Improves entry timing
Application: When entering trades

Rule: Price is delivered algorithmically to liquidity and inefficiencies. Markets aren't random - they seek specific levels for specific reasons.
Priority: MEDIUM - Conceptual understanding
Application: When understanding market mechanics

Rule: Follow smart money (institutions), fade dumb money (retail). Smart money creates displacement, dumb money creates consolidation.
Priority: HIGH - Helps identify trade direction
Application: When analyzing market moves

============================================================
