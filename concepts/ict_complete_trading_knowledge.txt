we have the run here creating the initial buy&nbsp;
side liquidity and the low taking that out here&nbsp;&nbsp;
so we have a minor cell side liquidity pool&nbsp;
we're working the initial cell side liquidity&nbsp;
that initial liquidity is an interest to me&nbsp;&nbsp;
so that disrupted all that price action over
the minor cell side liquidity it's inside the&nbsp;&nbsp;
highlighted as a layered cells side liquidity pool&nbsp;&nbsp;
which is initial buy side we've already ran that&nbsp;&nbsp;
and started to sell off so on the on the buy side&nbsp;
to tell me for a buy or sell it's not giving&nbsp;
like supposed diagonal support and resistance&nbsp;&nbsp;
price action and they're they're hinting to the&nbsp;
about last week where we have Smart money Concepts&nbsp;
time and price and liquidity and inefficiencies if&nbsp;&nbsp;
Central tenants that go along with retail trading&nbsp;&nbsp;
um you can just trade the just the price action&nbsp;&nbsp;
when we have opportunities to see the price action&nbsp;
what you're looking for if you're if you're afraid&nbsp;&nbsp;
see a limit order was filled you see they a stop&nbsp;&nbsp;
me the opportunity and displacement and and it&nbsp;
ran to obvious levels of liquidity it took out&nbsp;&nbsp;
this shortterm low I wasn't interested in having&nbsp;
idea and then I see a displacement I might in&nbsp;&nbsp;
a short with a fair value Gap a institutional&nbsp;&nbsp;
order flow entry drill um I don't know maybe a&nbsp;
bearish order block something something to that&nbsp;&nbsp;
and this one here has a lot of liquidity in it&nbsp;&nbsp;
liquidity big big players in the marketplace are&nbsp;
the market will go just above a short-term High&nbsp;
and Wednesday I would go back in and short up&nbsp;
above it it rallied up it took liquidity and&nbsp;&nbsp;
have an old new day opening Gap here we'll have&nbsp;
last week that the new day opening gaps have a&nbsp;&nbsp;
back into new day opening gap of the 9th okay&nbsp;&nbsp;
so that's Friday new day opening Gap that would&nbsp;
algorithmic so it has to refer back to those same&nbsp;&nbsp;
of the layered liquidity here upper quadrant&nbsp;
it works and smart money concepts are nonsense and&nbsp;
there's no algorithm but here you again I told you&nbsp;&nbsp;
I would not be interested in trying to buy it&nbsp;&nbsp;
nice displacement lower it just really just tore&nbsp;
following along and went short take your profits&nbsp;&nbsp;
as the initial point of buy side liquidity&nbsp;&nbsp;
fizzling out and they are no no longer supporting&nbsp;&nbsp;
buying and being profitable or you're selling and&nbsp;&nbsp;
being profitable and all the losses in between and&nbsp;
and you understand the effects of manipulation&nbsp;&nbsp;
going to go up to this level buy it at this&nbsp;&nbsp;
it's almost like uh reading price action isn't it&nbsp;
so the buy side is taken and just for good measure&nbsp;
Gap okay and the market trades up into the fair&nbsp;&nbsp;
lower and then we have displacement in here so&nbsp;
if we go back through all this price action here&nbsp;&nbsp;
and say okay I can see the fair value gaps I can&nbsp;
see the inversion fair value gaps he's talking&nbsp;&nbsp;
about I can see um I can see the order blocks okay&nbsp;
trying to trade and get short I'm going to use&nbsp;
fill but it doesn't do it and it runs the other&nbsp;
and the pawns will fall so if I share my stop loss&nbsp;&nbsp;
creating liquidity and even a larger Bullseye so&nbsp;
think they understand fair value gaps and whatnot&nbsp;
sell off not if you don't have the information&nbsp;
idea of my order block and because they tried to&nbsp;
named ICT and these smart money Concepts and they&nbsp;&nbsp;
that movie well the same thing in price action if&nbsp;&nbsp;
in the London session or trading the afternoon&nbsp;
time determining where the liquidity is and then&nbsp;
bearish order block why because it's going above&nbsp;&nbsp;
listen folks this is for order block fans okay&nbsp;
my order block does not require the trade below&nbsp;&nbsp;
my interest was being short I wanted to be short&nbsp;
trade or maybe it didn't give me a fill and or it&nbsp;
uh weekly previous week's range to be profitable&nbsp;&nbsp;
probabilities are better in the short than going&nbsp;&nbsp;
week determine what your initial high for buy side&nbsp;
is and what your initial low is for your sell side&nbsp;&nbsp;
bias that bias doesn't have to be the daily range&nbsp;
and and we have new day opening gaps below the&nbsp;
Market's going to discover probe into discount&nbsp;
chart that closing price right there validates&nbsp;&nbsp;
this is a bearish order block all I need to do is&nbsp;
open below this and then trade up where's my fill&nbsp;&nbsp;
and trades up I'm selling short when the Market's&nbsp;
going up okay stop loss goes to rejection block&nbsp;&nbsp;
which is the close on the order block so we have a&nbsp;
to the initial buy side liquidity that's these&nbsp;
back there because there is an algorithm I know&nbsp;
it to you every day and the market trades again&nbsp;
there's a volume imbalance there so you have to&nbsp;
this is probably boring you but long story short&nbsp;
here that justifies that fill except for I pushed&nbsp;&nbsp;
my inefficiencies and fair value gaps whether&nbsp;&nbsp;
how you know the algorithm is doing exactly what&nbsp;&nbsp;
and price and what the algorithm is doing what the&nbsp;&nbsp;
algorithm is doing this and when the algorithm is&nbsp;
to believe there's an algorithm but then when you&nbsp;
algorithm I'm enjoying the fact that I'm rubbing&nbsp;
fair value Gap that should act as resistance&nbsp;&nbsp;
or if you are using a reclaimed fair value Gap&nbsp;
that's a premium array a premium array you want&nbsp;&nbsp;
how you know the algorithm is respecting number&nbsp;
you're going to see a measurable displacement in&nbsp;
algorithmic signature that I want to see in that&nbsp;
I need to see an immediate response and rejection&nbsp;
fair value gap on that time frame because I've&nbsp;
already missed the rejection but I waited and&nbsp;&nbsp;
Candlestick right here it is a bearish order block&nbsp;&nbsp;
so that validates that as a bearish order block&nbsp;
short I'm not going to worry about if it fills me&nbsp;
get inside of this order block between its opening&nbsp;
a specific range that's formed by the order block&nbsp;
so it goes just outside of the the fair value Gap&nbsp;
do you know how to place your stop losses where&nbsp;
they're at ICT when you put those stop losses in&nbsp;&nbsp;
to the order block because that's what starts this&nbsp;
minor cell side liquidity here why is it a minor&nbsp;
the next new day opening Gap it's August
selling short it's going to keep dropping no it's&nbsp;&nbsp;
we're at notice I'm no longer interested if it&nbsp;
that the market was going to do the selloff here&nbsp;
made a a run of profitable trades what what&nbsp;&nbsp;
a stop loss and it's going to cause you to want&nbsp;
is is they're going to give out a a discounted&nbsp;&nbsp;
discount code I'm not going to do that I'm trying&nbsp;&nbsp;
when it's trading into a fair value Gap or it's&nbsp;&nbsp;
trading right above a short-term high that should&nbsp;
short but everything I'm doing behind the scenes&nbsp;
you note this buy side or note this sell side I've&nbsp;&nbsp;
go and you can use any retail logic entry pattern&nbsp;&nbsp;
premium oh you were talking about that in&nbsp;
and clustering of new day opening gaps all of&nbsp;&nbsp;
last week's new day opening gaps where&nbsp;
we above it so the algorithm is going to do what&nbsp;&nbsp;
it's going to seek fair value in a discount&nbsp;
deliver sell size delivery that means it's going&nbsp;
to enter a sell program it means it's going to&nbsp;&nbsp;
new day opening gaps clustering below where price&nbsp;
I'm not afraid I'm literally high on goofballs&nbsp;&nbsp;
that as a bearish order block not because it&nbsp;
they call the fu candle it's an Institutional&nbsp;
as an Institutional candle okay you multi&nbsp;
of that order block it does not need to be up
that's my entry on that candle I don't have them&nbsp;&nbsp;
price and that's the fill okay that's the logic&nbsp;
the market trades with this fair value Gap and&nbsp;&nbsp;
we have this order block as well so the opening&nbsp;
in a sell program that means there's going to&nbsp;
be sell side delivery that means the Market's&nbsp;&nbsp;
for inefficiencies that are in a discount and or&nbsp;
sell stops which is sells side liquidity so what&nbsp;&nbsp;
does that mean I want to be selling short when&nbsp;
that's a bearish order block okay so we have this&nbsp;&nbsp;
threshold entry the easy one the one I know I'm&nbsp;
getting it because of a limit order not filling&nbsp;
what is it it's the low of that fair value gap on&nbsp;&nbsp;
Candlestick right here is a bearish order block&nbsp;&nbsp;
it touching this fair value Gap again notice&nbsp;&nbsp;
that so am I going to adjust the stop loss&nbsp;
another entry no and when I add to it here am I&nbsp;
going to trade and aggressively lower my stop loss&nbsp;&nbsp;
that fair value Gap right there and essentially&nbsp;
the midpoint of this order block which is mean&nbsp;&nbsp;
you're thinking the algorithm is going to stop&nbsp;&nbsp;
algorithm no they're not they're not okay they're&nbsp;&nbsp;
so anyway as um as I was watching price action&nbsp;
liquidity then they run the liquidity that's the&nbsp;
manipulation when you see that manipulation guess&nbsp;&nbsp;
30 handles if they even hold a trade that long and&nbsp;
you'll go in and buy because it you know it's&nbsp;&nbsp;
you would no longer be in a trade and you have&nbsp;&nbsp;
algorithm because if I'm pulling out&nbsp;&nbsp;
futures or back off on Silver contracts or crew&nbsp;&nbsp;
will constantly keep pressing into liquidity I&nbsp;&nbsp;
cuz I only want to be a buyer then when I first&nbsp;&nbsp;
where the buy side IM balance consequent cro would&nbsp;
be that they would go down there to sweep them and&nbsp;
go short because I'm going to say here's the sell&nbsp;
it's this is the sell side level he's talking&nbsp;
of Premium aray that means go through the time&nbsp;&nbsp;
see the fair value gaps the inversion fair value&nbsp;&nbsp;
gaps the order blocks as I'm talking about here&nbsp;
to to an order block I'm just showing you how when&nbsp;&nbsp;
you're bearish and the market is in sell side&nbsp;
no algorithm or it's going to stop working or I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;
they're afraid so there's no there's no concern&nbsp;&nbsp;
are all questions I asked myself initially as a&nbsp;
trailed stop loss so it's not a loss um when I&nbsp;&nbsp;
Gap or a clustering of new day opening gaps so&nbsp;
idea I taught when I was teaching liquidity but&nbsp;&nbsp;
new day opening gaps the market will tend to seek&nbsp;&nbsp;
get on board with a fair value Gap institutional&nbsp;
orderflow entry drill a bearish breaker&nbsp;&nbsp;
a bearish order block a bearish mitigation block&nbsp;
inversion fair value Gap that used to be viewed&nbsp;&nbsp;
not SMC smart money Concepts Trader you understand&nbsp;&nbsp;
taught but this is the shortest route through it&nbsp;&nbsp;
how to buy and sell and pyramid and every entry&nbsp;&nbsp;
easy you'll anticipate fair value gaps when it's&nbsp;&nbsp;
buttons you're just tape reading you're going&nbsp;
to drive up into that fair value Gap and then I&nbsp;
the formation of the fair value Gap waiting for&nbsp;&nbsp;
price action and you can see what it's doing how&nbsp;&nbsp;
every premium array that means anything that I ICT&nbsp;&nbsp;
could use to get into a short idea which one makes&nbsp;
there no algorithm doesn't work and all of a&nbsp;
leverage it's be it becomes your job you when you&nbsp;&nbsp;
your supervisor is asking you to do nobody does&nbsp;&nbsp;
at the charts or trade anymore especially if you&nbsp;
